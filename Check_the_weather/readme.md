## Check the Weather - API

This project creates a simple command-line tool that provides instant weather reports based on city names or ZIP codes. It has clear prompts and strong error handling to make it user-friendly for non-technical users. The underlying code showcases practical skills in API usage, JSON handling, and reusable function design, which are valuable in data engineering tasks.


## Summary
- User-friendly design: Accepts city names or ZIP codes as input with clear instructions.
- API integration: Retrieves real-time weather data using a public weather API.
- Error handling: Handles missing/incorrect user input and API errors gracefully.
- JSON processing: Parses and presents weather data in a clean, readable format.


## Limitations & Next Steps
- Currently limited to one API and current weather data only.
- May need an API key, which requires a free signup (instructions can be included in the README).
