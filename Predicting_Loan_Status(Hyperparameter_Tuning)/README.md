## üè¶ Best Model for Predicting Loan Status (Hyperparameter Tuning)
This project aims to predict if a loan application will be approved. I cleaned the data, converted text fields into numeric features, and tested three models. Hyperparameter tuning revealed that a Logistic Regression model achieved the best accuracy at about 80 percent, outperforming the other models while remaining easy to explain. The outcome is a practical tool that helps lenders make faster and fairer decisions.

## Summary
- Data cleaned: Dropped ID, missing rows, one-hot encoding.
- Three models compared with cross-validation and grid search.
- Logistic Regression outperformed other models (KNN, Random Forest).

## ‚è≠Limitations & Next Steps
- Could add more models or use advanced feature engineering.
- Class imbalance and other metrics (precision, recall) could be explored.
