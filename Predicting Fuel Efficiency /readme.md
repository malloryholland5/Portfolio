## ⛽️Fuel-Efficiency Prediction

This project predicts a car's fuel efficiency based on engine specs and weight. After correcting missing horsepower values and encoding the origin, I compared a basic Linear Regression model with a tuned Decision Tree. The Linear Regression model achieved an R² of 0.82, while the Decision Tree improved accuracy to 0.86 but showed some overfitting. This project provides a clear, data-backed tool to help buyers and automakers understand real-world fuel costs.

## Summary
- Data cleaned: Fixed missing horsepower values, encoded car origin, dropped unnecessary columns.
- Models: Compared Linear Regression (R² ≈ 0.82) with Decision Tree Regression (R² ≈ 0.86).
- Performance: Decision Tree improved accuracy but showed some overfitting.
- Insights: Model helps buyers and automakers understand real-world fuel costs based on engine and weight specs.

## Next Steps
- Could add more features (e.g., aerodynamics, tire type).
- Explore model tuning and cross-validation for improved generalization.
