# Best Model for Predicting Loan Status 
This project aims to predict if a loan application will be approved. I cleaned the data, converted text fields into numeric features, and tested three models. Hyperparameter tuning revealed that a Logistic Regression model achieved the best accuracy at about 80 percent, outperforming the other models while remaining easy to explain. The outcome is a practical tool that helps lenders make faster and fairer decisions.
